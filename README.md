## !!! NOT FINISHED YET !!!

### what should i do?
i take the leetcode webpage and parse data from it
there should be a test to see whether current webpage is leetcode or not

problem data is located in props
the code for the problem is in div#editor
testcases are either in session storage or i take default ones from props

there is no way to tell what language does a user writing in
besides checking the div#editor button textContent, which is unstable
but there is no way to check it otherwise

i take the fileformat, and use that data to check what fileformat for a file should i use
and take necessary headers to make the file work
and also it's needed to process the testcases
